I"ğ<p>In January 2021 I was able to present research at the 237th AAS Conference, titled â€œPilot study for the autonomous discovery
of unknown unknowns in photometric timeseries dataâ€. Using techniques from machine learning, we were able to perform 
completely autonomous outlier detection on a large dataset of timeseries data.</p>

<p>The poster for the research can be found <a href="aas237-aas.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=EA-72-95-16-C7-B9-D6-DC-30-0F-67-BE-30-55-7D-C4">here</a>.</p>
