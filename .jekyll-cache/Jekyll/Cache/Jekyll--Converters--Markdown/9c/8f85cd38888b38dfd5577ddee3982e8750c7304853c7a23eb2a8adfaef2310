<p>The purpose of this website is to showcase some of the work Iâ€™ve done as a student, researcher, or in my free time.
Much of the code that was used to produce these projects can be found in <a href="https://github.com/rggs/">my GitHub</a>. However, it should
be noted that that code may be incomplete, as these projects represent a compilation of work, not a description of a single script.
Further, some code is missing entirely thanks to issues with dual-boot Ubuntu installs.</p>
