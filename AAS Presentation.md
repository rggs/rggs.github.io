In January 2021 I was able to present research at the 237th AAS Conference, titled "Pilot study for the autonomous discovery
of unknown unknowns in photometric timeseries data". Using techniques from machine learning, we were able to perform 
completely autonomous outlier detection on a large dataset of timeseries data.  

The poster for the research can be found [here](aas237-aas.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=EA-72-95-16-C7-B9-D6-DC-30-0F-67-BE-30-55-7D-C4).
